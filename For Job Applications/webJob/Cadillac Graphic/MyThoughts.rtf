\f0\fs24 \cf0 For this design I went to the Cadillac website to get information about a car model. I gathered all of the info into a text file and then put the image I needed onto my desktop. I fired up Photoshop and placed the car on and decided to keep it fairly simple. I added a gradient to make the background more interesting and to make it seem like the highlights on the car are coming from it. The font I found was from TypeKit, felt pretty luxurious. }
