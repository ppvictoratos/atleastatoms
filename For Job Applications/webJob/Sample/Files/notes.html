		Use
the file placeholder_1.jpg to use as an image for each of the staff members.

Create an image next to each person with a border around it,
 a shadow as well?

 include an image including: GENERIC LOGO
 call the thing GENERIC EMPLOYEES
 "dont you hate seeing the word generic?"
 employees wearing a t shirt that says generic 
 make each name! a link to their profile that has the blown up version of their profle picture and some random blurb you found

 put name and info underneath each headshot
 
 6 Male
 2 Female
 -->

 things to do:

 make every image the same size but in the same aspect ratio
 make sure that they keep size if window is moved
 make the background boxes only cover the words, not the entire page

 i either need to resize my images so that they are the same or something
